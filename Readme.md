# Invoice Generator in Python

## Overview

This is a simple and customizable **Invoice Generator** built using Python and the **ReportLab** library. It allows you to generate PDF invoices for a business or personal use. You can specify invoice details, customer information, and the items to be billed, and it will create a professional-looking invoice in a PDF format.

## Features

* Generate invoices in **PDF** format.
* Add company information, logo (optional), and custom header/footer.
* Automatically calculate the total cost for items.
* Easy-to-use command-line interface to enter invoice details.
* Customizable layout for company and item details.

## Requirements

To use this project, you need Python 3.x installed along with the following libraries:

* `reportlab` — for PDF generation
* `datetime` — for handling date and time

You can install the required libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install reportlab
```

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KrishnaAdhikarii/invoice-generator.git
   cd invoice-generator
   ```

2. **Run the Script**:

   In the terminal, run the following command to generate an invoice:

   ```bash
   python invoice_generator.py
   ```

3. **Enter Invoice Details**:

   When prompted, enter the following details:

   * **Invoice Number**: Unique identifier for the invoice.
   * **Customer Name**: The name of the customer you’re billing.
   * **Items**: For each item, you will need to enter:

     * **Item Name**: Description of the product or service.
     * **Quantity**: How many units of the item.
     * **Price**: The price per unit.

   If you don’t want to add more items, type **`done`** when prompted for the item name.

4. **View the Generated Invoice**:

   Once you’ve entered all the details, a PDF file will be generated with the invoice details. The file will be named using the invoice number (e.g., `INV-1234.pdf`).

## Customization

* **Company Info**: In the `generate_invoice()` function, you can customize the company name and address.
* **Logo**: If you want to include your company’s logo, just add the image path to the `company_logo` variable in the script.
* **Colors and Fonts**: You can change the colors and fonts used in the PDF by modifying the `setFillColor()` and `setFont()` functions.

## Example

```bash
Enter invoice number: INV-2023-001
Enter customer name: John Doe
Enter item name (or 'done' to finish): Widget
Enter quantity: 3
Enter price per item: 19.99
Enter item name (or 'done' to finish): done
Invoice saved as 'INV-2023-001.pdf'
```

The generated PDF will contain a summary of the invoice, including the item name, quantity, price, and the total amount due.
